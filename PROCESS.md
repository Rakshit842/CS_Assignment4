# Project Overview and Development Process

## Project Overview

The Simple Python Console Calculator serves as a foundational project to demonstrate skills in basic programming logic, Git version control, and Markdown documentation. It is designed to be highly accessible and function purely through the command line.

## Development Process

1.  **Initial Setup:** Created the project directory and initialized the Git repository.
2.  **Core Logic:** Implemented the `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide` functions.
3.  **User Interface:** Built the main `while` loop to repeatedly prompt the user for an operation choice.
4.  **Refinement:** Implemented **`try...except`** blocks to catch `ValueError` (for invalid input) and `ZeroDivisionError` (for dividing by zero), ensuring the application doesn't crash.
5.  **Documentation:** Added the `.gitignore`, `README.md`, and the `docs/` folder for comprehensive project material.

## Future Improvements

* **Advanced Operations:** Add support for exponentiation (`**`), modulus (`%`), and square roots.
* **User Experience (UX):** Implement a better way to exit the program instead of just closing the console window.
* **GUI:** Transition the application from a console-based tool to a simple graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt.
