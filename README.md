#Project Title

Mini project of Calculator (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) – Python/Java/C

Key Concepts in the Code:-
   -Functions (def): Used to encapsulate each mathematical operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide). This makes the code modular and reusable.
   -User Input (input()): Used to get the operator choice and the two numbers from the user.
   -Type Conversion (float()): Converts the string input from the user into a floating-point number so that mathematical operations can be performed, allowing for decimal numbers.
   -Conditional Logic (if, elif, else): Used to check the user's operation choice and execute the correct function.
   -Looping (while True): Keeps the calculator running until the user explicitly chooses to exit.
   -Error Handling (try...except): Used to catch ValueError if the user enters non-numeric input for the numbers, and to prevent division by zero in the divide function.
