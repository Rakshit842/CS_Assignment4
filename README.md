# Project Title

Mini project of Calculator (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) – Python/Java/C

**Key Concepts in the Code:**
- Functions (def): Used to encapsulate each mathematical operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide). This makes the code modular and reusable.
- User Input (input()): Used to get the operator choice and the two numbers from the user.
- Type Conversion (float()): Converts the string input from the user into a floating-point number so that mathematical operations can be performed, allowing for decimal numbers.
- Conditional Logic (if, elif, else): Used to check the user's operation choice and execute the correct function.
- Looping (while True): Keeps the calculator running until the user explicitly chooses to exit.
- Error Handling (try...except): Used to catch ValueError if the user enters non-numeric input for the numbers, and to prevent division by zero in the divide function.

# Project feature list
 The project features a clear development roadmap for the Python calculator.
The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) includes basic arithmetic functionality, robust error handling for division by zero and invalid input, and a continuous calculation loop.
- Key Enhancements (Should-Haves) aim to improve user experience by:
- Adding support for single-line expression input.
- Expanding operators to include Exponentiation and Modulus.
- Implementing a calculation history.<br>
<br>**Future-state scientific capabilities (Could-Haves) include:**
- Incorporating trigonometric and logarithmic functions (requiring the math module).
- Implementing memory functions (M+, M-, MR).
- A significant upgrade to a Graphical User Interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter, transforming the project from a command-line utility to a user-friendly application.
